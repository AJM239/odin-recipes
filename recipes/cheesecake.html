        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><strong>Cheesecake</strong> is <em>a decadent dessert featuring a smooth, creamy filling made with cream cheese, sugar, eggs, 
                and sometimes sour cream.</em> filling sits on top of a buttery crust, often made from crushed graham crackers. 
                Baked until set, cheesecake boasts a rich texture that can be dense or light depending on the recipe. 
                It's frequently topped with fruit, chocolate, or caramel for added flavor and visual appeal.</p>
