# odin-recipes

This project is part of the Odin Project's Foundations course, designed to start people in the craft of web development.
In this short project, I will be putting my very basic HTML skills to the test, by creating a very basic and rustic
recipes page. Hopefully, with this project I will hone, as I mentioned before, my basic HTML skills, so as to create
a solid foundation for furthering my web development skills.

For my final thoughts, I can say that, finally, I truly understand the value of best practices and being very attentive to details,
for example, with the privacy attributes in the <a> elements. In a second working of the page, I added CSS style to the pages, in an attempt to enhance their appeal to the viewer.
